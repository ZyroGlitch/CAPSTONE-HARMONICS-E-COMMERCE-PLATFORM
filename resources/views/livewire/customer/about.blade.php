            <p>Feelmore was founded in 1990. Our branch remained in Manila for some time, then
                grew into the Visayasregion before expanding to Luzon and Mindanao. We currently
                have seven branches in the Philippines and want to develop further in the future. Of
                course, I couldn't have grown it correctly without the assistance of those who trusted
                me. We all worked hard to make Feelmore last longer and generate jobs for many
                more people</p>
